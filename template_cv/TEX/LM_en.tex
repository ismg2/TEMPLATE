\textbf{Engineering Internship :  }
\newline{}

Dear ...,\newline{}

\hspace{0.8cm} It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application f...
After three years in two different engineering school such as \textbf{Grenoble Institute of Technology} and \textbf{EPFL} (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), I have developed various skills about electronic embedded system and specially around analog and RF integrated circuit with a special view on low power designs using the EKV model built here in EPFL. 


\hspace{0.8cm} As you will see from the attached resume, I’ve built my experience in a variety of roles and projects, most of my projects are related to analog design in integrated circuit. For instance, my actual project with the \textbf{ESPLAB} (Electronic and Signal Processing Laboratory), which goal is to design from scratch a bandgap voltage reference in CMOS technology using advanced structure discovered these years. This purely technical project is the opportunity to extend my technical skills outside engineering school frame, moreover I have the occasion to strengthen my autonomy, precision and rigorousness.

\hspace{0.8cm} Through different occasion, I also had the occasion to work in large groups. During my last internship, I had the chance to integrate \textbf{Rolls-Royce Civil Nuclear} electronic division.
With this team, I worked on imporving methods to use a specifical tool such as Mathcad. 
The purpose was to built a metodology that permit everyone to re-use design calculation of one card and adapt it easily to another card, having a uniform way of describing the most used electronic function in Mathcad. 
This work implied that this method was approuved and understood by everyone in the team, which induced a big communication work round everyone in the electronic division to understand all needs and obstacle. 

\hspace{0.8cm} Last, I want you to know my longtime interest on \entreprise, the large area of your product application ( !!! ,Automotive , Healthcare, IoT ...), in addition to the very wide range of \entreprise's client that show the leadership of this company present in several countries from Brazil to the USA, in Europe and Asia. \entreprise gather every assets that make it very attractive for futur engineers.   


\hspace{0.8cm}In closing, I would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the value that I can bring to \entreprise. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.
